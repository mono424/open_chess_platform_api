# Open Chess Platform API
This package offers a unified interface to interact with chess platoforms.

## Current Status

Currently I am working on getting lichess implemented. So work in progress ...

Later this repo will only contain generic code, nothing platoform specific.

Every chess platform should have its own repository and should be a own pub.dev package.

This repository should be a dependecy to the platform specific repos.
